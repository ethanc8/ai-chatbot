## Running locally

### By itself

Please get the `.env.local` file from @ethanc8. Then you should run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then whenever you want to run it, just use `pnpm dev`.

### With access to the Vercel project

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
